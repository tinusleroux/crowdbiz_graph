├── ui.py                 # Monolithic Streamlit app
├── api_simple.py         # Simple FastAPI endpoints
├── config.py            # Basic configuration
├── logger.py            # Simple logging
└── Various utility files
```

### ✅ Phase 4: Services Layer Creation
- **import_service.py**: CSV import with privacy filtering and validation
- **search_service.py**: Unified search across contacts, companies, articles
- **analytics_service.py**: Comprehensive analytics and reporting

### ✅ Phase 5: UI Component Migration
- **main.py**: Modular Streamlit application with navigation
- **components/sidebar.py**: Reusable sidebar component
- **pages/**: Dedicated pages for dashboard, search, imports, analytics
- Maintained all original functionality with improved organization

### ✅ Phase 6: API Migration
- **api/main.py**: Complete FastAPI application rewrite
- RESTful endpoints for search, data access, imports, analytics
- Uses services layer for business logic separation
- Maintained backward compatibility

### ✅ Phase 7: Testing and Validation
- Validated all module imports successful
- Fixed Python import path issues (relative → absolute imports)
- Confirmed application startup functionality
- Verified core services integration

### ✅ Phase 8: Final Cleanup and Validation
- Created migration documentation
- Validated complete system functionality
- Confirmed AI guidance systems operational
- Migration successfully completed
